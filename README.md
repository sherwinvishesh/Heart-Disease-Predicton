# Heart Disease Predictor


## Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using various machine learning models. The analysis is conducted in Python and covers detailed exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, and comparison to identify the most effective prediction model.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is located under `Assets/dataset.csv` and includes several attributes divided into demographic, behavioral, medical history, current medical condition, and a target variable for heart disease prediction.


## Source:
-  the source of your dataset 


## Attributes:

### Demographic:
- List demographic attributes (e.g., age, sex).

### Behavioral:
- Mention behavioral attributes if any (e.g., smoking status).

### Medical History:
- Include attributes related to medical history (e.g., previous diagnoses).

### Current Medical Condition:
- List attributes concerning current health conditions (e.g., blood pressure levels).

### Target Variable:
- `HeartDisease`: Indicates the presence of heart disease in the patient.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section provides insights into missing variables, data distribution, and correlations among different attributes. Key findings include the relationship between age and heart disease presence, distribution of various factors, and a correlation heatmap to understand interdependencies.
